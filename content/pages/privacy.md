# Chronobit Studios Privacy Policy
 
Chronobit Studios, LLC. (“Chronobit”) is committed to protecting your privacy.  We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the Personal Data we collect via any Chronobit application (each, an “App”) and our websites, including www.chronobit.com each, a “Site”).  This Privacy Policy generally applies to all users of Chronobit’s Apps who are age 13 or older.  For users under age 13, please refer to our Children’s Privacy Policy.
 
## Types of Data We Collect

#### Information You Provide

We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Site and Apps.  We collect personal information you provide to us.  For example, we collect your name, email address or other address you provide, and any other information you provide us when you contact us for support or provide feedback.  We may also collect any information you provide us, such as your name, postal address, zip code, country of origin, and email, when you: (i) respond to one of our surveys, (ii) participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, (iii) sign up for one of our newsletters, or (iv) sign up to one of our pre-registration sites.  We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Apps.

We may request that you provide your age information, including your date of birth to customize our App’s content and other features.  If your child identifies himself or herself as under the age of 13, please see our Children’s Privacy Policy for a description of how we collect, use and share information we collect from children under the age of 13.
We may also collect personal information at other points on the App that state that personal information is being collected.

When you use one of our Apps, some information is automatically collected.  For example, we collect a unique identifier for the device on which you install an App (“DID”, which may be your Apple Game Center ID (if you have signed up to Game Center and we have access to that ID)) and develop a profile about you keyed to that DID.  We may store your DID with your contact information (like your email address) when you contact us for support, but otherwise we do not associate your DID with Personal Data we collect about you.
Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) also collect information from you, including your browser type, device type, operating system, application software, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), MAC address, Open Device Identification Number (ODIN), domain name, date/time stamps for your use of the App, and your DID. 

Our Apps may also allow you to make “in-App” purchases.

Our Apps may also automatically receive age information, including date of birth, from the platform provider or which is associated with your DID.

We may combine the information we collect via Our Ads with other information we collect via our Apps.

# Chronobit Studios Childrens Privacy Policy

Children’s Privacy Policy
 
Chronobit Studios, LLC. (“Chronobit,” “we,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your child’s privacy. This Children’s Privacy Policy explains to parents and guardians (“you”) how we collect, use, and share Personal Information from users of Chronobit’s downloadable applications (each an “App”) who identify themselves as under 13 years old (“children”). This Children’s Privacy Policy does not apply to users 13 year old or older; such users should refer to the Chronobit Privacy Policy. 
 
### Note To Parents
Chronobit is required under the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with limited exceptions, to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose Personal Information (as defined below) from children.  Many of our Apps are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.  When our Apps request age information from your child and your child indicates that he/she is under 13 years old, the App will block your child from providing personal information, including through social networking features.  Please note, that if your child indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, your child WILL NOT be blocked from using our Apps.
 
### Information Your Child Provides
In general, we do not collect personal information, except in those instances under COPPA where personal information may be collected without verifiable parental consent.

#### Data Your Child Provides to Us

If your child provides us feedback or contacts us (for support, for example), we will collect the data included in the communication.  We use this personal information to assist your child with his/her query or support request and then delete such information once we have fulfilled the child’s query or support request.

If your child participates in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, we will collect any data your child provides, we may use it for the purpose of the promotion, and then delete such data after the promotion, to the extent the deletion of such data is permissible by law.

Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in a game, the offering of a prize, or another activity on the child’s disclosing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity. 
 
### Your Child’s Information Collected via Technology

When your child use one of our Apps, some information is automatically collected.  For example, we collect a unique identifier for the device on which you install an App (“DID”, which may be your child’s Apple Game Center ID (if you have signed up to Game Center and we have access to that ID)) and develop a profile about your child keyed to that DID.

Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) also collect information from your child, including your child’s browser type, device type, operating system, application software, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), MAC address, Open Device Identification Number (ODIN), domain name, date/time stamps for your use of the App, and your child’s DID.

Our Apps may also allow your child to make “in-App” purchases.  If your child makes an “in-App” purchase we will automatically collect information related to your child’s purchase, or may receive such information from the platform provider (e.g. Apple or Google), including the item purchased, the name of the game your child is playing, billing information and other information about your purchase.

Our Apps may also automatically receive age information, including date of birth, from the platform provider which is associated with your DID.

We may also automatically collect information related to the overall effectiveness of our advertising campaigns via our advertisements delivered on our web sites, apps and services (“Our Ads”).   For example, we may collect information related to the number of people who click on Our Ads, and the number of people who download one of our Apps or other products via Our Ads.  We may combine the information we collect via Our Ads with other information we collect via our Apps.
 
### Information Collected From Third Party Companies. 
#### Analytics
We may share your child’s DID or other information with companies that perform analytics regarding our Apps (or enable such companies to collect your DID or other information): to analyze the use of the Apps for us; and for advertising about Chronobit and other companies.

#### Third Party Websites
When your child clicks on a link to any other website or location, you or your child will leave our Site or App and go to another site and another entity may collect data from you or your child.  We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content.  Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you or your child click on links to such outside websites.

#### Third Party Advertisements

Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your child’s IP address, your ISP, your DID, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, email address, telephone number or other forms of personal information).
